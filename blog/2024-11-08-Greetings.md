# Greetings
You found my random blog/documentation site, **CONGRATES!!!**

<!-- truncate -->
Hello I am RDG. What are you going to get from this site, Well mainly random babbling from myself and documentation with typo's and grammar's mistakes everywhere!!!!~unless my wife catches it~

Little background, I am currently the one and only NA Regional CoE infrastructure system administrator for a global manufacturing company in the US. I mainly focus on our Window Servers, Active Directory, M365, Entra, Azure, powershell, cybersecurity and assist with networking. Even with all those duties I still pick up random help desk() ticket on a daily bases. Our local help desk it only 2 people across 4 site in 2 states, excluding myself and regional IT Manager. The two things that caused me to look into creating this site was:

1. I have been working on a lot of powershell script. I am sharing these with the local and global team causing me to document it and make less spaghetti.
1. Learning Azure cloud and terraform. 

I figured I would document my process I took to learning and implementing azure and terraform, along with share my scripts. This way when I need to refresh my forgetful self I have something to look back on. 

Bye!
