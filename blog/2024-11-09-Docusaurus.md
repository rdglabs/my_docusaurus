# Docusaurus on Github Pages

What I wanted from this site and why did I select Docusaurus and Github Pages

<!-- truncate -->

As I mention in my last post I am wanting to document my process I took to learning and implementing azure and terraform, along with share my scripts. I also have a small homelab setup. The usually process that happens is; I set something up, get it working as intended, don't do anything with it for a few months. Then when something needs fixed or updated I have to "remember" what I all did. With this site I am hoping that when something needs fixed/changed/updated I don't have to spend hours relearning it and can complete the change in a couple minutes. Lofty goals. 

## Docusaurus

I have used other documentation methods, simple text docs, one note, [bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/), [wordpress](https://wordpress.com), [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org), to name some. In a previous position I had setup bookstack for internal documentation and my current job we have confluence, both use/support Markdown and I really enjoy using markdown for documentation. I always find selecting `insert table` and then formatting it  to be cumbersome, while it can look nicer I just didn't want to. I came across Docusaurus via a post on reddit and after looking into it I like it enough to try it. It takes markdown files and generate static pages from them. It can do the blog and document structure, it seems to have a lot of plugins and other features, that I have not done anything with yet. Maybe one day. I didn't want to mess with permissions or structure that comes with bookstack. On a side note, if you are looking for application to publish an KB at your work, look at [bookstack](https://bookstackapp.com). It can do internal and external very easy and had good layout. The other deciding factor I wanted for this site was low cost to host it. 

## Hosting
I actually come across github pages before finding docusaurus. I was going though [Github pages class](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) messing around with the set up they have by default, using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). After going though that class I was tested it out and trying to figure out how to apply a theme. During this time I found that reddit post I mentioned earlier, talking about Docusaurus.

Now off to figuring out how to host the docusaurus site with ideally no cost, like github pages. At first I didn't think it was possible but later did figure out
